        <h1>Bruce Lee - Philosophy</h1>
        <p>Bruce Lee's philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to claim that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings. He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self-knowledge, and said that his chosen method of self-expression was martial arts.</p>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Bruce Lee's philosophy was a key part of his life and martial arts practice. One of his most famous quotes is:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/bruce_lee_383809">
        Be water, my friend.
    </blockquote>

    <section class="column">
        <h2>Jeet Kune Do</h2>
        <p>Jeet Kune Do, also Jeet Kun Do, and abbreviated JKD, is a hybrid philosophy of martial arts heavily influenced by the personal philosophy and experiences of martial artist Bruce Lee, who founded the system in 1967. Bruce Lee's philosophy can be summarized using his own words: “having no method as method; having no limit as limit.”. He developed an entire style and philosophy of martial arts all his own, much of it recorded in his book Tao of Jeet Kune Do – with adaptability being one of his tenets and the basis for his famous saying, ‘be water’.</p>

    <section class="column">
        <h2>Be Water, My Friend</h2>
        <p>One of Bruce Lee's most famous quotes is "Be water, my friend". He believed in the importance of adapting to situations fluidly without being rigidly attached to any single approach. The philosophy is like water, it cannot be contained to one area. Bruce realized that if he applied philosophy to one area of his life, like martial arts, he could apply it to other parts such as his acting career.</p>

        <h2>Self-Expression</h2>
        <p>Bruce Lee saw martial arts as a means of self-expression. He believed that each individual must discover their own approach rather than blindly following others. When I look around, I always learn something and that is to be always yourself, and to express yourself, to have faith in yourself. Do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it. Start from the very root of your being, which is “how can I be me?”.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="column">
        <h2>Overcoming Obstacles</h2>
        <p>The years between the Green Hornet and the Hong Kong films were often difficult for Bruce Lee. In Hollywood he wasn’t getting offered the roles he felt he deserved, he struggled to support his family and he injured his back very seriously and was told that he would never be able to do martial arts again. He turned to many self-help books during this time for inspiration. One day, he took one of his business cards and wrote the words “Walk On!” on the back and placed it where he could see it as a constant reminder to always keep moving forward. With this as his mantra, Bruce Lee worked himself back into physical health and used this time to write about down his many thoughts on marital arts and life resulting in the writings we now have today. When life gives you obstacles, you must summon the courage and walk on!</p>
